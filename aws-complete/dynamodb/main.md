# dynamodb
dynamodb is nosql database provided by aws.It is designed to store and manage large amounts of data with low latency and high availability.

# Why do we use DynamoDB?
- Scalable: It can handle large amounts of data and high request traffic without the need for manual scaling.
- Fast: It provides quick read and write operations, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- Managed: AWS handles maintenance tasks like backups, patching, and scaling, so you donâ€™t have to worry about infrastructure.
- Flexible: You can store various types of data without needing a fixed schema.
1. scalable
2. flexible
3. fast
3. managed

# differnece between dynamodb and rds:
- DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, best for large-scale, flexible data storage with fast read/write speeds, and no fixed schema.
- RDS (Relational Database Service) is a SQL-based database, ideal for structured data with a fixed schema, and supports traditional databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
